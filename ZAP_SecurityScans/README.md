# OWASP ZAP Vulnerability Assessment Guide

## Introduction
OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is a popular open-source security tool used for identifying vulnerabilities in web applications. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for using ZAP to scan and analyze the security risks of a web page.

---

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- A system running Windows, Linux, or macOS
- Java installed (if using the cross-platform version)
- OWASP ZAP downloaded from [https://www.zaproxy.org/download/](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/)
- A web application or target website for scanning (Ensure you have permission to test the website)

---

## Installation and Setup
1. Download and install OWASP ZAP from the official website.
2. Launch ZAP. On the first run, choose **"Automated Scan"** mode for a quick scan or **"Manual Explore"** for a detailed test.

---

## Automated Scan (Basic Test)
1. In the **"Quick Start"** tab, enter the target URL in the "URL to attack" field.
2. Click **"Attack"** to begin scanning.
3. ZAP will crawl the website and identify vulnerabilities automatically.
4. Review the alerts in the **"Alerts"** tab to see detected issues.

---

## Manual Explore (Advanced Test)
1. Configure your web browser to use ZAP as a proxy:
   - Set the proxy to `localhost:8080` in browser settings.
   - Install ZAPâ€™s root certificate to avoid HTTPS issues (found in Tools > Options > Dynamic SSL Certificates).
2. Browse the target website manually through the browser to let ZAP intercept requests.
3. Review the site structure in the **"Sites"** panel.
4. Use **Spider Scan** to crawl additional pages manually.
5. Use **Active Scan** to run deeper security tests on the identified endpoints.

---

## Analyzing and Interpreting Results
- Navigate to the **"Alerts"** tab to review vulnerabilities categorized by severity (High, Medium, Low, and Informational).
- Click on each alert to see details, including:
  - Description of the issue
  - Risk level
  - Possible fixes
  - Request/response data

---

## Generating Reports
1. Go to **"Report"** > **"Generate Report"**.
2. Choose the format (HTML, XML, JSON, etc.).
3. Save the report for documentation and further analysis.

---

## Remediation and Retesting
- Work with developers to fix identified vulnerabilities.
- Re-run the scan after applying fixes to verify resolution.

---

## Conclusion
OWASP ZAP is a powerful tool for identifying security risks in web applications. By following this guide, users can conduct basic and advanced vulnerability assessments effectively. Regular testing helps ensure robust web security.
